# Session status — CLI-style Portfolio

Date: 2025-10-22

Summary of current state
- Project scaffold created in `next-portfolio/` (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind).
- Files added: pages, styles, tailwind/postcss config, tools helper, README, `.gitignore` and more.
- Build: `npm run build` completed successfully in this environment.
- Git: `.gitignore` and `README.md` added. Git initialization attempts from the agent failed earlier because `git` was not available in the agent environment. You installed Git locally but the terminal session didn't detect it yet.

What to do before restarting VS Code (recommended checklist)
1. Save all files in the editor (Ctrl+S or File -> Save All).
2. Close any running dev servers in terminals (Ctrl+C in the terminal running `npm run dev`) — processes will stop on restart.
3. Verify `git` is available in your terminal:

```powershell
git --version
where.exe git
```

4. If `git` is detected, configure and commit the project (run from `next-portfolio`):

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Nando\portfolio\next-portfolio
git config user.name "Fernando Marques"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial Next.js portfolio scaffold with CLI-style theme"
git branch -M main
```

5. Create a remote on GitHub and push (optional / when ready):

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/NkM20/portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```

6. Restart VS Code (close and re-open). After restart:
- Terminals and background servers will have stopped; re-open a terminal and run `npm run dev` if needed.
- Git should be available in the new terminal if installed correctly — if not, log out/in or restart your OS to refresh PATH.

If you want me to record the current chat contents into a file or create a commit for you, tell me and I will prepare that file now for you to commit.

Notes
- Restarting VS Code will NOT delete any files in the workspace. Your files are saved on disk and safe. The only things that are ephemeral are running terminals, server processes, and unsaved editor buffers.
- If you need a snapshot of this chat, I can create a text file with the conversation summary or the next steps and place it in the project folder.
